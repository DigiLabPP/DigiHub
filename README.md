The Logic Minimizer was built using the Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm by [pyCoder01](https://github.com/pyCoder03). The flask Application was developed by [hariharan-tech](https://github.com/hariharan-tech). It takes number of variables, variable names, Minterms and Don't cares as Input and produces the Product of Sum (POS) and Sum of Product (SOP) as output.
